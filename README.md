# DynaSLAM Docker
This application builds DynaSLAM algorithm in a docker container. <br/>
It is required to have [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) installed. <br/>

# Build the docker 
Run the following command to build the docker. Building the docker can take a while, and at least 15GB from disk space.
```
mkdir Dataset
sudo docker build -t dyna .
```

# Run the docker
The following command will open a docker terminal
```
./Run_docker.sh
```
# Access data from/to Docker
To move files from/to the docker just move to the ```Dataset``` folder (for example, the SLAM sequence dataset)

The data set can be downloaded using the following link:

```

https://cvg.cit.tum.de/rgbd/dataset/freiburg3/rgbd_dataset_freiburg3_walking_xyz.tgz

```
# Run DynaSLAM
To run DynaSLAM a important note is to execute the terminal command at /root/DynaSLAM. Executions outside this folder will probably return Segmentation fault message. 
```
./Examples/RGB-D/rgbd_tum Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/RGB-D/TUM3.yaml /home/Dataset/rgbd_dataset_freiburg3_walking_xyz/ Examples/RGB-D/associations/fr3_walking_xyz.txt src/python/mask_rcnn_coco.h5 /home/DynaSLAM/output
```

# Exit the docker
Inside the docker just type the following command, but the docker will still be activate when you leave:
```
exit
```
If you want to return to the docker process:
```
./Attach_docker.sh
```

# Kill docker process
Outside the docker, type the following command to show all docker process running
```
docker ps -a
```
To kill a docker: 
```
docker rm <CONTAINER ID> 
```

# Remove Docker image
Outside the docker, type the following command to show all docker images running
```
docker images
```
To erase a docker image:
```
docker rmi <IMAGE ID>
```
